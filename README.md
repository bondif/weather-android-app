# Weather App and much more üòã

This is a weather forcast android application using OpenWeatherMap and images search engine using Pixabay + Google Maps for locations

This project is given by M. Mohamed Youssfi ( https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCwIYNpQVHZTd3Vx_krnmdA ) as end of semester project.

The application uses OpenWeatherMap ( https://openweathermap.org ) to display weather information (min temperature, max temperature, pressure and humidity) about the next 5 days.

It also uses Pixabay ( https://pixabay.com/service/about/api ) to load images based on a query, and finally it allows to take pictures and automatically stores location of this picture in a SQLite database, to view them later using Google Maps.

Make sure to edit the Google Maps API Key in [app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/bondif/weather-android-app/blob/master/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) in order for the Map to work.
